	content: 'Got a new 7 Pro I had TONS of problems updating is. Even returned one phone and got another. Turns out it never would have worked because OnePlus only had the most recent update and I needed an interim one. You\'d think OnePlus as the company selling would be aware of it. This app was recommended on reddit and while I was skeptical at first, the number of downloads, reviews and the vendor feedback won me over. Worked amazing! And now after two updates my phone works great! Happy paid customer!',

I am 1+ 6t user in USA and was still stuck on Android 9 WEEKS after 10 started rolling out (a couple months I guess if you count the stop/go/stop/go/stop/go rollout) . Installed this app and BAM! Updated to 10.3 in minutes with no hiccups! Outstanding job, developers!',

This app works perfectly with TalkBack which allows those who are blind to use our phones. Happy to purchased ad free & support developer. Thanks to Android Authority for informing me about this app.',

	content: 'I just recently discovered this app and I have to say it is awesome. I own a 7 pro and I am in the US. I kept waiting for the Android 10 OTA update but it never updated. I searched through forums and did most of the non-intrusive suggestions (wasn\'t going to factory reset my device if it could be avoided) but nothing worked. I was still stuck on Android 9 as of today...until I downloaded this app. The upgrade process was smooth and uneventful just the way I like it. 5 stars for this app.',
